# Data Structures & Algorithms

This repo contains code for various data structures and algorithms. Each example
will have tests associated with it that can be run from the command line. Code
examples will initially be written in ruby, but various languages will be added
over time. Below is a list of the various data structures and algorithms.

## Running the tests

To run the test for a given solution. `cd` into the correct directory and run the
command that corresponds to the language below:

### Ruby

```bash
$ ruby name_of_test.rb
```

## Data structures

### Binary Search

[Ruby](/binary_search/ruby)
